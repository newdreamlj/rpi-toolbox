v1.1.1 - 2015-xx-xx
===================

- Further fix for Client constructor for the case where "localhost" is
  unresolvable.


v1.1 - 2015-01-30
=================

- Add support for wildcard certificates. Closes #440547.
- Default connection behaviour has been reverted to MQTT v3.1 instead of
  v3.1.1. There is as yet insufficient support for v3.1.1 to rely on, and
  current v3.1 implementations do not return the correct CONNACK code to allow
  detection of the fault. Closes #451735.
- Fix incorrect handling of queued messages after reconnecting. Closes
  #452672.
- Fix possible race condition if the connection in loop_start() does not
  complete before loop_stop() is called, meaning the network thread never
  ends. Closes #448428. Thanks to Kees Bakker.


v1.0.2 - 2014-09-13
===================

- Fix "protocol" not being used in publish.single()
- Fix Client constructor for the case where "localhost" is unresolvable.
  Closes #439277.
- Don't attempt to encode topic to utf-8 twice. Thanks to Luc Milland.
- Handle "unicode" type payloads on Python 2.7. Thanks to Luc Milland.
- Fix reconnecting after sending more QoS>0 messages than inflight messages is
  set to, whilst connecting.  Closes #443935. Thanks to Hiram van Paassen.
- Fix possible race condition when connecting with TLS and publishing at the
  same time, which could lead to PUBLISH data being sent before any other
  messages and unencrypted. Closes #443964. Thanks to Hiram van Paassen.
- Handle exceptions from select() in client loop() function. Closes #443881.
  Thanks to Jeff Jasper.
